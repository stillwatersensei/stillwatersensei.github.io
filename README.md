# Stillwater v19

Full drop-in GitHub Pages bundle.

## Main update

v19 restores the opening/home screen and makes the home Sage use a real image-sequence sprite animation:

`assets/sage/idle-frames/frame-01.png` through `frame-12.png`

The app swaps those frame images with JavaScript. This is different from the older CSS-only swelling effect.

## Behavior

- Home screen uses animated idle sprite frames.
- Practice screen uses the stable Sage image fallback.
- Music is steady and does not change when sections change.
- Music advances to the next local MP3 when a track ends.
- After Final Bow completes, music stops, sound mode is set to Silence, and the app returns home.
- Sound settings are remembered with localStorage.
- CSS/JS cache busting is set to v=19.
